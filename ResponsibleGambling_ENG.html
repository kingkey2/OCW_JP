                        <p>
                            Problem gambling is a compulsion to continue gambling despite the negative consequences it
                            may have. If you are unsure whether or not your (or someone else&rsquo;s) gambling has
                            become a cause for concern please ask yourself the following:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li> ・Do you stay away from work, college or school to gamble?</li>
                            <li>・Do you gamble to escape from a boring or unhappy life?</li>
                            <li>
                                ・When gambling and you run out of money, do you feel lost and in despair, and need to
                                gamble
                                again as soon as possible?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                * Do you gamble until your last penny is gone, even the bus fare home or the cost of a
                                cup of
                                tea?
                            </li>
                            <li>* Have you recently tried to stop gambling but were unsuccessful?</li>
                            <li>* Have you ever lied to cover up the amount of money or time you have gambled?</li>
                            <li>* Have others ever criticized your gambling?</li>
                            <li>
                                * Have you lied, stolen or borrowed just to get money to gamble or to pay gambling
                                debts?
                            </li>
                            <li>* Are you reluctant to spend &quot;gambling money&quot; on anything else?</li>
                            <li>* Have you lost interest in your family, friends or interests?</li>
                            <li>
                                * After losing, do you feel you must try and win back your losses as soon as possible?
                            </li>
                            <li>* Do arguments, frustrations or disappointments make you want to gamble?</li>
                            <li>* Do you feel depressed or even suicidal because of your gambling?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The more you answer 'yes' to the above questions, the more likely your gambling has become a
                            concern.<br>

                            Should you feel the need to take a break from any gaming activities on our site, you have
                            the option to self-exclude yourself at any time for up to 90 days from the Self Exclusion
                            section when you access your My Account page. Once the self-exclusion period has been set,
                            no transactions can be transacted with your account and access to your account will be
                            restricted until the set period has passed.
                        </p>

                            Should you wish to exclude yourself for more
                            than 90 days, you can always send an email to
                            <a class="text-primary" href="mailto:support@casino-maharaja.com">support@casino-maharaja.com</a> to request for a
                            longer period to restrict you from accessing your account registered with us.

                        <p>
                            To prevent underage gambling, an automated Age and Identity verification check occurs at the
                            point
                            of successful registration. In the case that we are unable to ascertain a match to an 18 or
                            over
                            database, a physical copy of ID will be requested from the customer which must be provided
                            within 72
                            hours.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our efforts must be complemented by user behavior so we ask that if young people have access
                            to a computer with Internet access, you take care to keep your username, password and deposit
                            details confidential and ensure to log out of your CASINO MAHARAJA account.<br>

                            There are also a number of internet filtering software which can be installed on your
                            computer to
                            protect minors. Such software provides the ability to control content displayed, block
                            websites and
                            set up passwords to prevent gambling websites being available to underage players. E.g.
                            &ldquo;Net
                            Nanny&rdquo; or &ldquo;CyberPatrol&rdquo;
