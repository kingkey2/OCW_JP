  "本公司推薦選用 Tether 所發行的美金恆定幣作為主要提供玩家交易的幣種，而對應的區塊鍊合約類型共有 ERC20、TRC20、OMINI 三種，一般來說較常使用為 ERC20 或 TRC20，手續費較便宜且速度快，OMINI雖然安全性最高，但手續費較高且速度較慢，但還是提供玩家依照自己的喜好和習慣進行選擇。": "We recommend USDT, which is a stable coin issued and managed by Tether. We recommend it because it is issued against the U.S. Dollar, its price is stable, and it is the most commonly traded cryptocurrency among players. The three most commonly supported blockchains are ERC20, TRC20, and OMINI for contract types; OMINI is the most secure, but has higher fees and is a bit slower, so ERC20 and TRC20, which have lower fees and are faster, are generally more commonly used. However, players are free to choose whichever cryptocurrency they normally use.",
