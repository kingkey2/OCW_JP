                            You agree to provide us with any information we request to assist with our KYC (know your
                            customer) verification checks, and we reserve the right to request documents to verify the
                            following: (i) your identity, such as a valid photographic ID (e.g. a copy of your Driving
                            Licence, Passport, or National Identity Card); (ii) your residential address (for example,
                            utility bill, or bank, building society or credit union statements dated within the last
                            three months, tax bill or council tax bill issued during the current year); and (iii) proof
                            of ownership/authorization to use a certain payment method (for example, if you are using a
                            payment card a photo of the front and back of the payment card would be required, if you are
                            using a bank account we will request a bank statement or if you are using an e-wallet a
                            screenshot of the account that corresponds to the payment method will be required). We may
                            request that you provide any of these documents certified to attest their credibility. We
                            may also use additional verification tools available to us in order to verify the
                            authenticity of any documents you provide.

                            Furthermore, if we have reasonable grounds to believe that any documents provided by you are
                            not genuine or are inaccurate, we reserve the right to refuse such documents. Casino
                            Maharaja reserves the right to keep restricted any account until the relevant verification

                            close your account and return any remaining balance if verification checks have not been
                            carried out to our reasonable satisfaction within 30 calendar days from our first request
